# School_District_Analysis
Module 4

##	Overview of the School District Analysis
###	I am analysing school district data from high 
	school funding and standardized tests. Our goal is to report and 
	present an analysis that will give insights on performance patterns.
	The aggregated analysis will help the school district make strategic
	decisions.
##	Results
###	- Total School Budget:	 No change	
	- Per Student Budget:	 No change	
	- Average Math Score:	 Due to the negation of Thomas High School 9th
					 grader math scores, THS' score went down by .07% 	
	- Average Reading Score: Due to the negation of Thomas High School 9th 
					 grader reading scores,	THS' score went up by .05%
	- % Passing Math:		 Due to the negation of Thomas High School 9th
					 grader math scores, THS' score went down by .01%	
	- % Passing Reading:	 Due to the negation of Thomas High School 9th
					 grader reading scores,	THS' score went down by .3%
	- % Overall Passing:	 Due to the negation of Thomas High School 9th grader
					 math and reading scores, THS' score went down by .32%
##	Summary
###	1) All 9th grade scores for THS were turned into NaN's.
	2) Because of this, math and reading scores for THS changed.
	3) Average scores by school type were also affected. In general
	   charter school averages went down.
	4) Also note worthy, district averages went up.
